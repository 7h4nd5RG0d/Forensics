Before using Chainsaw you will need to export files from FTK imager.  
Following that use this command:    **./chainsaw hunt winevt -s sigma/ --mapping mappings/sigma-event-logs-all.yml -r rules/ --csv --output results**     (I specifically exported the winevt folder as it contains the .evtx files)  
After this the antivirus.csv has the needed info.  
Using WindowsDefenderExtractor tool we can extract the 4 files from the quarantine folder and find the malware usng virustotal.   
Decompyling and analyzing the malware we will get back the files and the flag is in Applicants.info
