# Something new:
1) bulk_extractor can be used to carve out a pcap from memory image --> **bulkextractor.exe  -x all -e net -o output_folder/ memdump.mem**  
2) userassist plugin of volatility --> stores userassist registry keys which stores which programs were executed and how frequently.  
3) **hindsight** can be used for **web forensics** in memory images.  
4) handles plugin of volatility --> lists the handles(files,sockets,processes..) used by a process with a specific PID.
5) strings plugin --> finds the virtual address of a string with input as "physical offset:string"
