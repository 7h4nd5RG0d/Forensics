## Solve:  
We have to provide the sha hash of the file executed from the extrenal drive.  
We are provided with Amcache.hve which can be parsed to find the only executable running in the extrnal drive(:E)  

Something new --> **Amcache.hve stores information of all apps stores info of all apps on the system.**
