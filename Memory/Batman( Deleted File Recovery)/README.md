# Something new:
1) **foremost** can be used to extract deleted files from memory.
2) Shadow Explorer can be used to recover files from Volume Shadow Copies.
3) **Volume Shadow Copies** are snapshots of a file system at a specific time.
4) These snapshots are created automatically when system restore point is generated. This happens when an application is installed, windows updates or significant changes are made. This is created once evry 24 hours.
5) The zone-identifier is an ADS of a file which stores metadata of a file.
6) Zone id values: 0--> local machine, 1--> local intranet, 2--> Trusted sites, 3--> Internet, 4--> Restricted sites
